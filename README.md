# SBMP
Small, Basketball-oriented Matchmaking Program
----------------------------------------------

SBoMP is what it say it is, basically it iterates through all possibilities of 10 players changing through team and positions (yes, the 3.6M possibilities) and selects drafts two teams that are as competitive as available.
